## 🎯 **Foundation Principles**

### **1. Context is King**
```
❌ Bad: "Fix this code"
✅ Good: "I'm building a React e-commerce app with TypeScript. 
This component handles user authentication but throws an error 
when logging in with invalid credentials. Here's the code:
[code snippet]. Please fix the error handling and add proper 
validation."
```

### **2. Be Specific About Requirements**
- **Input Format** - Specify expected data types, structure
- **Output Format** - Define desired response format (JSON, markdown, code only)
- **Constraints** - Performance, security, accessibility requirements
- **Technology Stack** - Frameworks, libraries, versions
- **Style Preferences** - Coding conventions, patterns

### **3. Iterative Refinement**
- Start with broad concepts, narrow down specifics
- Use follow-up questions to clarify ambiguities
- Refine based on initial AI responses
- Build complexity gradually

### **Context Setting Template**
```
Project: [Brief project description]
Tech Stack: [Languages, frameworks, tools]
Current Challenge: [Specific problem]

generate the implementation for [specific component].

Requirements:
- [Functional requirement 1]
- [Functional requirement 2]
- Performance: [targets]
- Security: [considerations]

Please include:
- Main implementation code
- Error handling
- Input validation
- Unit tests
- JSDoc comments"
```

#### **Phase 3: Testing & Validation**
```
Prompt: "Review this implementation of [feature] and:
1. Identify potential bugs or edge cases
2. Suggest additional test cases
3. Check for security vulnerabilities
4. Evaluate performance implications
5. Recommend improvements

Code: [implementation]"
```

### **2. Bug Fixing Workflow**

#### **Bug Analysis Template**
```
Prompt: "I'm experiencing a bug in my [app/component].

Symptoms: [What's happening]
Expected: [What should happen]
Environment: [Browser, OS, versions]
Steps to reproduce: [Detailed steps]
Error messages: [Exact error text]
Recent changes: [What was modified recently]

Code snippet: [Relevant code]

Please help me:
1. Identify the root cause
2. Provide a fix with explanation
3. Suggest prevention strategies"
```

### **3. Code Review Workflow**

#### **Review Request Template**
```
Prompt: "Please review this [component/function/module] for:

1. Code quality and best practices
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Performance optimizations
4. Maintainability improvements
5. Test coverage gaps

Context: [Purpose and requirements]
Code: [Implementation]

Focus areas: [Specific concerns]"
```

## ✅ **Quality Assurance**

### **Validation Checklist**
- [ ] **Functional Correctness** - Does it solve the problem?
- [ ] **Security** - Are there vulnerabilities?
- [ ] **Performance** - Will it scale appropriately?
- [ ] **Maintainability** - Is the code readable and well-structured?
- [ ] **Testing** - Are test cases comprehensive?
- [ ] **Documentation** - Is it properly documented?

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
1. **Vague Requirements** - "Make it better" vs. "Improve performance by reducing load time"
2. **Missing Context** - Not providing enough project background
3. **Over-reliance** - Not validating AI suggestions
4. **Ignoring Constraints** - Not specifying technical limitations
5. **Single-shot Prompting** - Not iterating and refining

### **Response Evaluation Framework**
```
Accuracy: Is the solution technically correct?
Completeness: Does it address all requirements?
Efficiency: Is it optimized for performance?
Security: Are security best practices followed?
Maintainability: Is the code clean and well-documented?
Testability: Can it be easily tested?
```

## 🚀 **Advanced Techniques**

### **1. Chain-of-Thought Prompting**
```
Prompt: "Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, analyze the requirements for [feature]
2. Then, design the data structure
3. Next, plan the API endpoints
4. Finally, implement the core logic

Start with step 1: requirement analysis..."
```

### **2. Few-Shot Learning**
```
Prompt: "Here are examples of how I prefer to structure components:

Example 1: [code snippet with structure]
Example 2: [another example]

Now create a similar component for [new requirement] 
following the same patterns."
```

### **3. Role-Based Prompting**
```
Prompt: "As a senior software architect reviewing a system design, 
evaluate this proposed architecture for scalability, maintainability, 
and security. Consider you have 10+ years of experience building 
similar systems..."
```

### **4. Multi-Model Orchestration**
```
Workflow:
1. Claude: Gather requirements and create user stories
2. OpenAI: Generate technical implementation
3. ULM: Analyze UI mockups and extract design tokens
4. Claude: Review and provide final recommendations
```

### **5. Template-Based Prompting**
```javascript
// Prompt Template
const generatePrompt = (context) => `
Project: ${context.project}
Task: ${context.task}
Tech Stack: ${context.techStack}
Requirements: ${context.requirements.join(', ')}
Constraints: ${context.constraints.join(', ')}

Please provide:
1. Implementation approach
2. Code with comments
3. Test cases
4. Documentation
`;
```
